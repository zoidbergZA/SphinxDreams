 * class Behaviour allows you to attach reusable behaviours to a GameObject.
 * Think of steering, rotating, billboarding, etc.
 * A Behaviour is set on a GameObject, which in turn passes in a reference to itself through the setOwner method.
 * This way we can enforce that a Behaviour can never have an owner different from the object it has been attached to.
 *
 * It is similar to MonoBehaviour in Unity.
