 * AbstractMaterial should be subclassed for all materials, for example ColorMaterial, TextureMaterial.

 * Basically a material is responsible for setting up the correct shader,
 * filling all the correct parameters and actually rendering a mesh by streaming all mesh data through a
 * specific shader. Subclasses often use a static shader variable which is initialized once upon first use,
 * but that is fully optional (!).
 *
 * This works like the Unity Material, where you have to select a shader for a material and the shader chosen
 * determines which properties actually become available for the material itself.
