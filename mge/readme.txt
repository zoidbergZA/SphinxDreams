Welcome back!
Having installed all dependencies correctly you should now be able to run the Micro Game Engine.

There are 2 different project files, one for static linking, one for dynamic linking.
In case you want to use the dynamic version, you'll have to include the dll's found under:
c++_3d_required_libraries.zip\dll_bundle_sfml2.3.2_glew_1.13.0 into your exe folder. 

In case you do not want to use codeblocks, you will have to download/compile the correct libraries and library versions for your IDE yourself.
Check the other readme's given in c++_3d_required_libraries.zip, 
they describe which libraries you need, how to build them, and which include and lib paths you need.

Other configurations than codeblocks are not actively supported yet.
